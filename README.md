# Linux System & App Updater Script

A comprehensive Bash script designed to automate the process of checking for and applying updates on a Linux system.

This script intelligently detects your distribution, system package manager, and a wide array of application and programming toolchains to provide a single, unified update command.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Smart Detection**: Automatically discovers your Linux distribution (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, openSUSE, etc.) and the correct system package manager (apt, dnf, pacman, zypper, etc.)
- **Comprehensive Updates**: Handles updates for system packages and app packages
- **Developer-Friendly**: Detects and offers to update a wide range of programming toolchains
- **Interactive**: Prompts for confirmation before checking and applying updates
- **Responsive**: Includes a text-based spinner animation for long-running update tasks
- **Selective**: Allows opting out of programming toolchain updates
- **Safe**: Uses `set -e` to exit immediately if any command fails
